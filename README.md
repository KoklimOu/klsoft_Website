Good morning.
Yes, it’s a new dawn.
Though unfortunately, I wouldn’t exactly describe it as refreshing.
I spent the night in one of the intact homes in the elf village.
It’s the kind of elf house you’d see in a story, carved into a giant tree
trunk.
Can you call that a tree house? Yeah, sure, why not? Probably.
Very fancy and fantastical and all that.
Big fairy-tale vibes, too.
I normally spend my nights sleeping in my own home, but I can’t resist
trying it out for a night if you show me something like this.
But I can’t say it was a very comfortable night’s sleep.
After all, this is a postwar zone.
Thanks to Potimas’s stupid secret weapons, like the sea urchins and that
pyramid thing, the formerly lush forest has been reduced to a wasteland.
Frankly, there’s a serious burnt smell.
This is pretty far away from the site of that battle, but you can still smell it
from way over here.
Not to mention that there were battles with robots and mega-robots in this
area, too, leaving plenty of scrap metal lying around.
Those robots clearly didn’t run on gasoline or other liquid fuel, so it’s not
like that’s leaking out and stinking up the place, but the faint smell of metal
and burnt parts is…less than pleasant.
Even if it’s not as bad as the stench from the burnt wasteland.
Man, I’d hate to have the Olfactory Enhancement skill at a time like this.
My sense of smell went back to normal when I became a god. Otherwise,
I bet I wouldn’t have been able to sleep, no matter how much I wanted to,
with that smell keeping me up.
Well, unless I just turned the skill off, I guess.
But there’s also the fact that it was elves who lived here.
That in and of itself is enough to make me a little nauseated.
Not to mention that we’re the ones who killed those residents.
It’s not like I’m afraid of ghosts or curses or whatever, but I can’t say it
doesn’t make me feel a teeny bit uncomfortable.
And of course, I suppose I have to mention the stink of blood and guts and
all that…
Overall, I would say it was just a really poorly timed stay in this particular
home.
Maybe if I were visiting or on a trip or something I might have felt
differently… Not in this situation, though.
I didn’t sleep well, and I think I had nightmares, too.
Since I just finally wrapped up a big job, you’d think I at least deserved a
good night’s sleep.
Then again, I guess it’s to be expected, given that the “big job” in
question was an elf genocide.
Yep, it was an all-out attack on the elf village.
Of course, the main goal was to take out Potimas.
It’s almost entirely his fault that this planet is in such a horrible state, you
know.
Destroying the cause would hopefully rectify the problem at least a little.
That was the idea, anyway.
Although there’s also the fact that Potimas and the Demon Lord had some
serious bad blood.
To be totally honest, I have mixed feelings about letting the Demon Lord
finish Potimas off herself.
By battling Potimas, the Demon Lord was able to finally destroy him like
she always wanted.
But it came at a serious cost.
The backlash from that battle has rendered the Demon Lord almost
entirely unable to fight.
And that’s not all.
In fact, this part is way more important: The Demon Lord’s life span has
been shortened to almost nothing.
Now, she already knew she wouldn’t live much longer, which is why she
took on the role of Demon Lord in the first place.
Physically, her body doesn’t age, but her soul was already reaching its
limits.
That was reflected in the Demon Lord’s stats.
All her stats and skills had long since stopped changing.
The stats and skills governed by the system are strengthened by absorbing
a portion of the soul of a defeated opponent in the form of “experience
points,” attaching that piece to one’s own soul.
Basically, the process forcibly expands your soul.
And the Demon Lord’s soul has already been blown up to the point of
bursting like an overfilled balloon.
So it can no longer absorb the soul pieces called experience points, which
is why her stats and skills can’t get any stronger.
And so the Demon Lord’s soul was unable to take on even more
experience points.
Either her soul would explode, or its contents would start leaking out like
a balloon with a hole poked into it.
Either way, the Demon Lord’s soul had reached its limits.
So she knew that she was going to die in the near future.
Except that’s by the standards of the Demon Lord, who’s lived a stupidly
long time.
From a normal human’s point of view, I’m sure she still had plenty of
time left.
But that was all used up in the battle against Potimas.
Now the Demon Lord looks like she could die at any moment.
Seeing her like this, I can’t help but wonder if letting her fight Potimas
was really the right move.
Even if it was her wish, maybe I should’ve dug in my heels and refused.
But at the same time, part of me also recognizes that because the Demon
Lord fought Potimas, I didn’t have to waste any precious energy.
It’s an invaluable victory that the Demon Lord won nearly at the cost of
her life, yet here I am looking at it in terms of numbers.
Even I have to admit that’s a pretty gross personality trait.
Man, I suck sometimes.
Ugh… I’ve gotta stop dwelling on this, though.
What’s done is done, and I can’t change it.
I’ll reflect on what I’ve done, but I won’t sit around and regret it.
Because regret just means you’re rejecting the person you were up until
that point.
No matter what happens, you’ve gotta accept it and use it as fuel to keep
moving forward.
All righty, then.
I guess that means my first order of business is checking on our prisoners
of war.
In this battle, we captured Yamada and the rest of his hero party.
The reincarnations who were being held in the elf village under the guise
of protection.
And Ms. Oka, the last surviving elf.
That’s it.
In other words, it’s almost all reincarnations.
Y’know, since we killed all the other elves.
The entire race of elves was really just based on a bunch of Potimas
clones anyway.
What this world knows as elves were all either Potimas’s clones, people
who got remodeled into elves, or their children.
From what I’ve heard, the elves were abducting people even before they
started kidnapping reincarnations specifically.
They’d turn the abductees into elves and have them make children with
Potimas’s clones.
Otherwise, if it was just Potimas clones reproducing, there’d be some
genetic side effects.
The children created in that way were raised as elves.
By nature, that means the majority of elves were blood relatives of
Potimas.
Is that even a race, or just a bloodline?
Well, at any rate, what I’m saying is that exterminating all the elves was
better for everyone in the long run.
The only exceptions are Ms. Oka and the half-elves.
Ms. Oka aside, it would’ve been a huge pain to take out all the half-elves,
too.
Even I’m not all-seeing, you know.
There are places I can’t reach, and more that I’ve overlooked, I’m sure.
I do think it’s for the best to wipe out the elves as thoroughly as possible,
but eliminating every last one outside the elf village here would be way too
much trouble.
I was bound to miss a few here and there.
So basically, I’m ignoring anyone who cut ties with the elves and went off
on their own.
Which includes the half elf in our pal Yamada’s party, too.
Apparently, she already died once, but that doesn’t count.
She came back to life, okay? All’s well that ends well.
Yamada might have gotten knocked out hard in the process, but that’s not
my problem!
Don’t look at me!
Seriously, it’s got nothing to do with me!
So yeah.
I’m a little nervous, but I guess I have to check on how Yamada made out,
huh?
It’s probably my fault that he passed out in the first place…
I bet it was you-know-what, right?
His Taboo skill finally maxed out?
What am I gonna do if that totally altered his personality or something…?
Aaah, I’m so nervous.
I guess I’ve gotta explain things to the other reincarnations, too, huh…?
Are we sure I can’t just get Mr. Oni to handle it?
Speaking isn’t exactly my strong suit.
In a way, this next quest is even harder than conquering the elf village.
I guess I should go scope things out.
The first thing I see when I leave the tree house is a mountain of corpses.
No, really. I’m being totally literal here.
The bodies that make up this actual mountain are what’s left of the
imperial army that invaded the elf village.
With Natsume leading the charge, they fought the elves, and then got
pincered in a surprise attack from the demon army behind them, leading to
their utter downfall.
While of course there are some survivors left, from a military standpoint
they’ve taken enough damage to call it more than a decimation.
It’s considered decimation if they lost at least 10 percent of their forces,
right?
Or was it twenty?
Well, either way, this is definitely more than that.
The troop Natsume was leading directly faced off against relatively
average foes like Yamada’s party and Ms. Oka; their losses were relatively
few.
But the other troops all got stuck fighting Potimas’s secret weapons, to the
point where some of them were completely obliterated.
And by secret weapons, I don’t mean the ones I fought, like the sea
urchins, or the Gloria Omega the Demon Lord fought.
I mean the ones I’ve been calling robots.
No, not even mega-robots. Just the regular mass-produced cannon fodder.
But while they might seem like hunks of junk from my perspective,
they’re a horrifying threat by the standards of most people in this world.
How big of a threat? you ask. Believe it or not, those robots were
probably on par with Earth Dragon Araba, if not stronger.
We’re talking weapons that no number of ordinary humans could stand a
chance against, and they’re mass-produced, popping up in droves from all
over the place.
Yeah. I can see why most of these guys kicked the bucket.
And there you have it: a mountain of corpses.
I guess the surviving imperial soldiers and Mera’s men stayed up all night
recovering them from the battlefield.
You mean while I was complaining about getting a bad night’s sleep,
these guys were working overnight right after fighting a hard battle all day?
Okay, that’s my bad.
Sorry for complaining about champagne problems, guys.
I guess I was lucky that I got to sleep at all.
Turns out soldiers in this parallel fantasy world fight until they die, and if
they don’t die, they get put to work all night. Worst working conditions ever.
Hey, all you isekai fans! Want to try getting reincarnated as a soldier in
another world?
…Yeah, now I’m starting to feel really bad for them.
Although this was all part of the plan in the first place, since I always
intended to use the imperial army as expendable pawns.
I even had Natsume gather soldiers from corrupt imperial noble families
and such, specifically so it wouldn’t be a big deal if they died… But it’s their
bosses who were at fault, not the soldiers.
I’m sure some of them were benefiting from those dirty dealings, but still.
Well, either way, they all played their parts perfectly well.
So I think they at least deserve to be properly mourned.
Obviously, they can’t carry all these corpses back to the empire, so they’ll
either have to make do with mementos or cremate the bodies and bring back
the ashes.
Either way, we’ll have to bury them with care and respect.
On the other hand, the elves’ corpses are nowhere in sight.
They’ve all vanished into my stomach.
Or the stomachs of my little clones, to be more precise.
Look, this is my way of showing respect to the dead, too, okay?
In the natural world, it’s only right to eat anything you’ve killed.
By eating their bodies, they become part of my flesh and blood.
Ah, the circle of life.
I’m sure Potimas would be thrilled to bits that his descendants became the
flesh and blood of a god, too, no doubt.
“Good morning, Lady White.”
As I look out at the mountain of corpses, Mera approaches me politely.
“Have you eaten breakfast yet? I would be happy to prepare something for
you.”
Okay, so he’s casually offering me breakfast.
I dunno about that one, chief.
Normally there’d be nothing strange about such an offer from an attentive
guy like Mera, but right now, he’s here as an army commander.
Since we’re technically the same rank, it’s gotta look weird to his
subordinates for him to make such a considerate offer to me.
And Mera’s usually good at keeping his personal life and his official
duties separate.
He’d never make it so obvious to his men that he considers himself below
me.
Okay, I really hope I’m wrong about this, but uh…
…Mera, you wouldn’t happen to be worried that I might try to eat these
corpses, would you?
If my eyes were open, I’m sure they’d be very narrowed right now.
Mera seems to pick up on this. His gaze wavers a little.
It’s such a slight shift that no ordinary person would notice, but nothing
gets past me.
How insulting.
But fine.
I really haven’t eaten breakfast yet. I guess I’ll take Mera up on his offer.
It’s the least he can do to make up for suspecting me like that.
Wait, what’s this?
I’m sensing a serious death glare, and even some magic, to boot.
Mera senses it a moment after I do and starts to move, but I raise a hand to
stop him.
“Hrmph, just as I suspected. This much isn’t even a threat to you, eh?”
The person who was radiating a threatening aura calmly walks toward me.
It’s one of the imperial army generals. I think his name is Ronandt.
Most people might know him as Julius the Hero’s magic teacher.
“What do you think you’re doing?”
Mera sends a death glare right back at Ronandt.
Thanks to skills like Intimidation, the power behind Mera’s threatening
aura is off the charts.
Some of the demon and imperial soldiers working nearby turn pale or
even faint.
Yet in the face of all that pressure, Ronandt maintains a cool smile.
Huh. Guess he’s lived longer than most other humans for a reason.
Mera’s stats far outmatch his on paper, but in terms of sheer presence,
Ronandt somehow seems like a bigger deal.
“Why, I was only offering a greeting, my boy.”
“Aha. So they shoot magic at each other as a greeting in the empire, do
they? I’ve never heard of such a custom.”
Mera only ramps up the intimidation factor in response to Ronandt’s aloof
attitude.
You could practically cut the tension in the air with a knife.
Except there is one little thing that’s already cutting the tension quite a
bit…
Um, am I allowed to ask about this?
Fiel, why are you hanging off Ronandt?
Since there’s a little girl clinging to his back, Mera just looks like some
jerk glaring at an old man and his granddaughter.
What’s going on here?
I don’t get it.
Even Mera seems perplexed beneath his air of intimidation.
I mean, can ya blame him?
“What a petty fellow, to get so worked up over such a trifling matter.
Indeed, this esteemed personage here has remained calm, eh? She clearly
knew that I did not truly intend to use that magic.”
Yeah, sure, except the main reason I’m not moving is that I’m totally
thrown off by the fact that Fiel is hanging off your back.
A smirking old geezer with a little girl on his back…
Seriously, what’s up with this guy?
“You see, I happen to have some shared history with your esteemed
friend. Of course, my existence is surely of little consequence to her, but that
is why I thought to introduce myself now, that she might learn my name.”
Um, okay. I already know your name.
Besides, you keep showing up in such memorable ways, I’m pretty sure I
couldn’t forget you even if I tried.
“My name is Ronandt Orozoi. Head mage of the imperial court of the
Renxandt Empire.”
He gives such a dramatic introduction that I can almost hear a DUN-
DUN-DUUUN!
And then, Fiel pulls on his cheeks.
Now there’s an old man standing in front of me making a frog face.
“PFFT?!”
Mera lets out a snort.
I barely manage to hold back a spit take myself.
How’s anyone supposed to keep it together when you make a weird face
at a time like that?!
Any professional comedian would kill for that level of humor!
I’ve got no choice but to laugh at this!
Shoot. I gotta get out of here or I’m gonna burst out laughing.
“Let’s go.”
“Erm, are you quite certain?”
I nod firmly at the utterly baffled Mera.
Quick, retreat while my abs and face muscles are still doing their job!
I turn my back on the old man, who’s still frozen with a frog face, and
swiftly walk away.
“What have you done, you little rascal?!”
I pretend not to hear the person shouting behind me.
Mera keeps glancing over his shoulder at the geezer, but I keep striding
away without hesitation, forcing him to follow after me.
It almost sounded like someone cried out, “P-please, come back!” behind
me, but I’m sure it’s not directed at me.
Must be part of their new comedy act or something.
So obviously I shouldn’t go back there.
Oof, I haven’t even met with the reincarnations yet and I’m already
exhausted all of a sudden.
No waaay.
While that run-in with a weird old man took the wind out of my sails, I
still let Mera lead the way for the sake of breakfast, and we arrive at a tree
house similar to the one I slept in.
The demon army does have tents and such for camping, but obviously a
building with a proper roof is the more comfortable choice.
Even if some of the areas got razed to the ground, the excessively large elf
village still has plenty of space for us to use.
There’s no reason not to take advantage, especially since it’s not like
anyone else is using them anymore.
“Oh? Good morning.”
In the tree house, Vampy is elegantly eating breakfast.
The wooden plates, presumably belonging to the prior owners of the
house, are loaded with all kinds of food.
The portion sizes are nothing crazy, since it’s just breakfast, but there’s
certainly a wide variety of options to make your mouth water.
Bread, salad, fruit, steaks cut into bite-size pieces, scrambled eggs…
It’s a much more luxurious breakfast than you’d expect the day after a
battle, and there’s Vampy, digging in daintily with a knife and fork.
What are you, nobility?!
Ah, I guess she really was born into a noble family.
“Please prepare portions for two more people,” Mera instructs his
subordinate in the back.
Looks like they’re using this place as a special dining hall for officers and
such.
The subordinate immediately withdraws farther into the back to carry out
his orders.
There must be a kitchen back there, I guess.
And wait, two more people? Is Mera gonna eat with us, then?
It feels like it’s been ages since I saw Vampy and Mera sit down for a
meal together.
Mera is technically Vampy’s servant, after all.
It must feel kinda weird for him to eat with his master.
Although it’s a little late for that now, since they always ate together
during our journey from Sariella to the demon territory.
Plus, Mera’s official position as a commander technically outranks
Vampy’s…
Hmm?
When you put it that way, isn’t Vampy the one out of place eating here?
Mera and I are both commanders, but Vampy doesn’t even have a rank,
does she?
What do the demon army soldiers who don’t know anything about the
situation make of this, I wonder?
Hmm…? Well, she does get officer treatment here. Maybe they’ve got
some idea what’s going on?
As I reflect on these pointless matters, Mera pulls out a chair for me.
Huh?! I’m seated all of a sudden!
What a gentleman!
Is this the power of chivalry?!
By the time I’m done marveling, Mera is already seated.
On closer inspection, Mera’s face looks pale with fatigue.
I can’t blame him—he fought the elves all day, then cleaned up after the
battle all night.
Doesn’t seem like he’s been eating much, either.
Otherwise, I doubt he would sit down to eat with me and Vampy.
He’d probably eat by himself to be polite.
I imagine there’s no one else here besides Vampy, because they’re all
working or sleeping off their exhaustion, too.
It feels really weird to see two vampires eating breakfast at the break of
dawn, though.
“Ms. Ariel is sleeping. Kyouya is guarding her. I’ve no idea where
Phelmina is.”
Evidently guessing my thoughts, Vampy tells me what the rest of the
usual gang is doing.
No idea about Phelmina, though, huh?
Knowing her, I’m sure she’s working her butt off, but that poor girl
doesn’t leave much of an impression.
In fact, Phelmina is my subordinate. If anyone should know what she’s
doing, it should be me, right?
…It’s fine! Nothing to worry about!
Yeah, for sure. Probably.
“Oh, and Kusama went to see the other reincarnations. I imagine they’re
eating breakfast together by now, perhaps?”
Kusama, Kusama… Oh, right.
The kid who was raised by the church and sucks at being a ninja.
Turns out Kusama’s father is one of the pontiff’s secret intelligence
agents, which is how the pontiff found out about reincarnations in the first
place.
He also recruited Kusama himself as an agent and trained him.
We were introduced to him when we formed a temporary alliance with the
pontiff against the elves.
He was relatively friendly with Mr. Oni in their previous lives, I think.
They were chatting during the breaks between our meeting with the pontiff.
Not that I got involved much. People like Vampy and me can’t quite keep
up with Kusama’s high energy.
Even back in his old life, Kusama was always kind of a class clown, life-
of-the-party guy.
Shadowy types like me and Vampy can’t hang out with sunny types like
him…
Why did someone loud and flashy like Kusama get a unique skill like
Ninja? Probably because his name is “Shinobu” or some stupid reason like
that.
Knowing D, it wouldn’t surprise me.
Funny, though…
